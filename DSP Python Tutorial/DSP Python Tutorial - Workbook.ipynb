    "# DSP Tutorial to Python, Numpy, and Matplotlib\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to be using the [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) data analysis ecosystem for many of the projects and homework in this class. When you get good at Python, it becomes an indispensable tool. Python itself is a high-level, interpreted general-purpose programming language. It becomes useful for data analysis through add-on libraries such as [NumPy (Numerical Python)](https://numpy.org/), [matplotlib (a plotting and visualization library)](https://matplotlib.org/), and many others. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is a cross-platform (Windows, Mac, and Linux) distribution and software environment manager that includes almost all of the major data analysis tools that you will need. Python and its data analysis libraries are free and open source but can often provide the same capabilities as the commercial product MATLAB.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to run python code. In this class, we are going to focus on using the [Jupyter Lab / Jupyter Notebook environment](https://jupyter.org/). This is what you are using right now. It provides a friendly, interactive interface to python while giving you the ability to add-in formatted notes and comments. This is done through markdown cells; you can get a basic syntax guide here: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/. You can even write equations directly in the markdown cells with $\\LaTeX$. [See here for documentation on $\\LaTeX$ in Jupyter Notebooks.]( https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html#LaTeX-equations)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are ideal for prototyping of your own ideas and code, sharing ideas with others, and submitting homework. As you need to do more complcated analysese, you may eventually move to actual python scripts and programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "The learning objectives of this tutorial are:\n",
    "1. Become familiar with the fundamentals of Jupyter Notebook and the Python Language.\n",
    "2. Learn the fundamentals of NumPy and Matplotlib\n",
    "3. Place these skills in the context of the Signals and Systems concepts we have learned in class so far."
